Why Are Some Bugs Non-Reproducible? An Empirical Investigation using Data Fusion
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Abstract**: Software developers attempt to reproduce software bugs to understand their erroneous 
behaviours and to fix them. Unfortunately, they often fail to reproduce (or fix) them, which leads to 
faulty, unreliable software systems. However, to date, only a little research has been done 
to better understand what makes the software bugs non-reproducible. In this paper, we conduct a multimodal 
study to better understand the non-reproducibility of software bugs. First, we perform an empirical 
study using 576 non-reproducible bug reports from two popular software systems (Firefox, Eclipse) 
and identify 11 key factors that might lead a reported bug to non-reproducibility. Second, 
we conduct a user study involving 13 professional developers where we investigate how the developers 
cope with non-reproducible bugs. We found that they either close these bugs or solicit for further 
information, which involves long deliberations and counter-productive manual searches. Third, we offer 
several actionable insights on how to avoid non-reproducibility (e.g., false-positive bug report detector) 
and improve reproducibility of the reported bugs (e.g., sandbox for bug reproduction) by combining our 
analyses from multiple studies (e.g., empirical study, developer study).
